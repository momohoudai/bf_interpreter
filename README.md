# BrainFuck Interpreter

This is an over-engineered BrainFuck Interpreter, mostly for my hobby, interest and education. 

It is a way for me to understand the steps taken in modern interpreters (namely lexing, parsing, runtime) in hopes of writing my own language and compilers in the future . 

The interpreter is also written in C so that I can also understand the kind of memory allocations I might need for each step.

## Building

Note that I have only tested this on GCC with Valgrind and GDB. 

All you need to do is to build `main.c`.
